The Critical Path Method (CPM) is a simple but powerful technique for analyzing, planning, and scheduling large, complex projects. It is used to determine a project’s critical path—the longest sequence of tasks that must be finished for the entire project to be complete. 

 CPM, also known as Critical Path Analysis (CPA), identifies dependencies between tasks, and shows which tasks are critical to a project.
