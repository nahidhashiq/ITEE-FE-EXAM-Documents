**Critical Path Management **

[Related Article]( https://www.workamajig.com/blog/critical-path-method)

The Critical Path Method (CPM) is a simple but powerful technique for analyzing, planning, and scheduling large, complex projects. It is used to determine a project’s critical path—the longest sequence of tasks that must be finished for the entire project to be complete. 

 CPM, also known as Critical Path Analysis (CPA), identifies dependencies between tasks, and shows which tasks are critical to a project.

 **Q55.** In order to analyze the trend of issues that occur in a project, the number of issues by 
management item, such as the stakeholders, cost, schedule, quality, etc., are arranged in 
order starting with the highest number of issues in the form of a bar graph, and a diagram is 
prepared in which the number of issues accumulated in this order are superimposed in the 
form of a line graph. Which of the following is this diagram? 

a) Cause and effect diagram

b) Control chart 

c) Pareto diagram 

d) Scatter diagram 

**Cause and Effect diagram**

A cause-effect diagram is a visual tool used to logically organize possible causes for a specific problem or effect by graphically displaying them in increasing detail, suggesting causal relationships among theories. A popular type is also referred to as a fishbone or Ishikawa diagram.

**Pareto chart**

This is a diagram that combines a bar graph and line graph to enable control and analysis by viewing the 
cumulative total percentages of the whole. Specifically, a bar graph is drawn with bars in descending orders 
by quantity, and the cumulative total percentage of the whole for each bar is represented with a line graph. 
This is used in situations including ABC analysis, which clarifies key control items.

**Control Chart**

The control chart is a graph used to study how a process changes over time. Data are plotted in time order. A control chart always has a central line for the average, an upper line for the upper control limit, and a lower line for the lower control limit. These lines are determined from historical data

**Scatter Diagram**

A scatter chart, also called a scatter plot, is a chart that shows the relationship between two variables. They are an incredibly powerful chart type, allowing viewers to immediately understand a relationship or trend, which would be impossible to see in almost any other form.
